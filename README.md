# MIDS
A matlab code for multivariate imputation of unequally sampled compositional variables in the 3D datasets via a direct sampling-based algorithm

Input parameters:
Validation=1	% 1= Use of code to validation with a reference data file
n_cat=1	% number of categorical variables                             
n = 12	% maximum number of points in the data event
"t1 = 0.2;"	% acceptance threshold for multivariate distance between central samples (between 0 and 1)
"t2 = 0.02;"	% acceptance threshold for multivariate distance between Data events
"nb_of_real=100;"	% number of realizations
"expo_w=1;"	% exponent of the inverse distance weights
"search_radius_z=20;"	% Max search radius in vertical direction (meter)
"search_radius_xy=20;"	% Max search radius in horizontal direction, (meter)
"z_comp_length=1;"	% Sample interval length (meter)
	
% missed value must be defiend as ''-999''
